        <!--height attribute changes size of text
            width attribute changes starting point of marquee
            default width is screen width
            align is useless here (not because it's red lol)
            loop is no of times marquee plays , by default it is endless
            Vspace shows actual vertical length of marquee
            Hspace shows actual horizontal length of marquee
            (width is from right, Hspace is from left)
            scrollamount is the distance in pixels,scrolldelay is the time in miliseconds
            together scrollamount and scrolldelay give speed of marquee
            direction can be up,down,left or right
            Behavior has following four values
            scroll: Scrolls the content continuously.
            slide: Scrolls the content once and stops at the end.
            (means if content is "awwab" in scroll it will stop when starting a reaches end of screen
             and in slide it will stop when ending b reaches end of screen)
            alternate: Scrolls the content continuously, changing direction when it reaches the end.
            (default start is left to right)
            alternate-reverse: Similar to alternate, but starts with the opposite direction.
            (may not work)-->
